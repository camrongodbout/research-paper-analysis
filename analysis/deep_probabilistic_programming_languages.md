# Title: Deep Probabilistic Programming Languages: A Qualitative Study

## Quick Summary:
This paper takes a look at deep probabilistic programming languages (PPL) and evaluates them by comparing them on a programming level through using an example of the bias of a coin. It serves as an introduction to Pyro and Edward.

## What I found interesting
How this paper includes diagrams and code for different libraries on the same problem. It takes an unbiased approach to each library and shows them in comparison.

## What was confusing
The code examples were a little hard to read because they were scrunched down in the paper.

## Further topics to research based off this paper:
More applications of deep probabilistic modeling

## Possible Applications of Paper's Idea:
I am always drawn to the idea of using deep probilistic modeling with sports and fantasy sports.
